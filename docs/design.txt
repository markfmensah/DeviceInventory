//Problem Statement
A program that will save a list of computer makes and models and the amount available. 
This program will prompt the user to enter the amount of computer models available. 
Next, using the number entered, the program will loop prompting the user to enter the computer make, model and amount available. 
These values will be saved into separate arrays and displayed after everything is entered.




//Nouns and Verbs
Nouns : list of computer makes, list of computer models, amount
Verbs : prompt, save, display




//Defining Diagram
INPUTS:
  makeCount
  makeName
  modelCount
  modelName

PROCESSING:
  prompt user for makeCount
  prompt user for makeName
  prompt user for modelCount
  prompt user for modelName
  calculate totalMake
  calculate totalModel
  calculate totalDevice

OUTPUTS:
  makeName
  modelName
  modelCount
  totalMake
  totalModel
  totalDevice




//Solution Algorithm
GetModels(deviceMake)
  set counter to zero
  prompt for modelCount
  WHILE (counter < modelCount)
    prompt for deviceModelName
    prompt for deviceModelCount
  ENDWHILE
  return deviceModelCount, deviceModelName
END

GetDevices(makeCount)
  setCounter to zero
  WHILE (counter < makeCount)
    prompt for deviceMake
    GetModels(deviceMake)
  ENDWHILE
  return deviceMake, deviceModelCount, deviceModelName
END

main
  prompt for makeCount
  GetDevices(makeCount)
  set counter to zero
  WHILE (counter < makeCount)
    display deviceMake, deviceModelName, deviceModelCount, totalDeviceCount
  ENDWHILE
END
